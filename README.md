# 📊 Statistics Project

## 📌 Description
This project was conducted as part of the **Ironhack Bootcamp**. The goal is to explore and analyze data using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**, and to perform an **A/B Testing** experiment to assess the impact of a new user interface.

## 📁 Project Contents
- `cleaned_datav3_new.ipynb` : Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis and A/B Testing.
- `Vanguard.twb` : Tableau Dashboard for visualizing experiment results.
- `data/` : Folder containing datasets used for analysis.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
- **Git & GitHub**
- **Tableau** (for data visualization)

## 🔬 Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** : Cleaning and analyzing trends in the dataset.
2. **Defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** : Measuring completion rate, time spent, and error rate.
3. **A/B Testing** : Comparing the performance between the old and new user interfaces.
4. **Visualizing Results** : Using Tableau and Python graphs.

## 📊 Results & Insights
📌 *Summary of key findings, insights, and conclusions drawn from the analysis should be added here.*
